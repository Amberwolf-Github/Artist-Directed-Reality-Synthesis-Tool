# Original Artist Proposal

The following text is reproduced verbatim from the original artist post that inspired ADRS.

---

There are a lot of artists out there who cant' actually do the work itself that they want to do for various reasons.

Sometimes it's a physical disability, sometimes a monetary issue (including complete lack of time to learn or practice, because of having to spend all that time on making enough money to survive). Sometimes it's a mental or psychological inabilty to comprehend or understand or translate things in a way that allows them to create that art.

So I would like to help create a tool that would help those of us like that (which includes me in all of those ways).

I don't know enough about any of the things need to do this to actually do it myself, so I would like to ask those that might to take a peek at this project and see if they can help, or if they would be willing to work on it.

The basis of the tool is a form of "ai", like those image generators everybody's got, but something that actually "listens" to the artist and does what they ask it to, especially as regards to POV, style, movement, lighting, and in what the artist does not want there, and the very specific things the artist does want.

It also must take whatever visual input the artist has, be that photos, drawings, storyboards, pictures of crayon marks on the wall, whatever, and create the things the artist asked for, not just invent them...but be capable of inventing the things the artist does not have details of or doesn't know how to tell it what they are.

Then it must create each thing in the "scene" or image as it's own object file or image file, an overall scene file to tell it where all that stuff goes and how to light it, etc. that can be locally saved by the artist for future iterations, and be able to iteratively modify each of these and their interactions, so that all the things that will inevitably be wrong can be modified until they are what the artist originally conceived.

At present none of the image tools can do any of those things.

So, something new is needed.
