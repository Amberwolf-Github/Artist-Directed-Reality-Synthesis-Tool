# ADRS Vision

Artist‑Directed Reality Synthesis (ADRS) is conceived as an **expressive prosthesis**.

The artist defines:
- What exists
- What must not exist
- Spatial relationships
- Scale
- Lighting
- Motion
- Point of view
- Temporal evolution

The system fills in *only what the artist has not specified*, and does so **without breaking constraints**.

ADRS treats scenes as persistent, editable realities:
- Objects are objects, not pixels
- Time is explicit
- Change is local and reversible

This is not prompt‑roulette.
This is authored reality.
