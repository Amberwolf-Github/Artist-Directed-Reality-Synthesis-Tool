# Accessibility Commitments

ADRS is designed for creators who cannot:
- Draw reliably
- Model in 3D
- Use fine motor controls
- Spend years learning complex tools
- Iterate manually

Design goals:
- Full keyboard operation
- Scriptable interfaces
- Deterministic regeneration
- Constraint‑based edits instead of redraws
- Compatibility with assistive technologies
- Voice and symbolic input as future targets

Accessibility is not an add‑on.
It is the reason ADRS exists.
