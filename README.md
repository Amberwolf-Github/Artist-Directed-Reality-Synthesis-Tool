# Artist-Directed-Reality-Synthesis-Tool
A tool for Artists to use constrained generative tools (image, etc) to create the specific results they envision, and iteravely refine the output to get ther exact vision as a final result.  

ADRS is an open‑source, accessibility‑first system for creating visual art, animation, and simulated realities **under direct artist control**.

Unlike current generative tools that produce disposable, non‑deterministic images, ADRS is designed to:
- Respect artist intent
- Preserve structure, scale, and constraints
- Support iterative refinement
- Enable still images, animation, and 3D scenes
- Be usable by people with physical, cognitive, or economic barriers

ADRS originated from a real artist need, not a corporate product roadmap.

## Core Principles
- Artist intent is authoritative
- Constraints matter more than novelty
- Determinism is required for iteration
- Accessibility is a first‑class requirement
- Open source, forever
